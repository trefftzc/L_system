# L_system
Using an L_system to display the LDT space filling curve.

Daniel Palm has created python code that can generate space filling curves in python.

The code generates .png files with the corresponding curve.

It is based on grammars. His original repository is this:

https://github.com/Nightwind0/lsystems/blob/master/generate.py

The purpose of this COLAB notebook is to explore how other space filing curves can be generated.

The LDT space filling curve has been created by Dettling, DeVries and Trefftz.

Its grammar will be used to generate a png image.
